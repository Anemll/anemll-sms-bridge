Designed to provide Grok Chat for Starlink Direct to Cell service (T-Mobile, September 2025)
Related: [X post by anemll](https://x.com/anemll/status/1963318984331465018)

A Flask application that bridges SMS messages with xAI's Grok model using Twilio, enabling AI-powered conversations via satellite SMS connectivity.

## Primary Use Case: Starlink Direct to Cell

This SMS Bridge enables **satellite-based SMS access to Grok AI** for users with Starlink Direct to Cell service through T-Mobile. Users can send SMS messages from anywhere with satellite connectivity and receive AI-powered responses, making advanced AI capabilities available even in the most remote locations without traditional cellular or internet infrastructure.

### Key Benefits:
- üåç **Global Coverage**: Access Grok AI from anywhere with Starlink Direct to Cell
- üì° **Satellite Connectivity**: No traditional cellular or internet required
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Responses**: Full Grok AI capabilities via simple SMS
- üîÑ **Bidirectional Communication**: Send questions, receive detailed AI responses
- üìÖ **Future-Ready**: Designed for T-Mobile's September 2025 rollout

## Features

- Receive SMS messages via Twilio webhook
- Process messages through Grok AI (xAI)
- Send AI-generated responses back via SMS
- Environment-based configuration
- Error handling and message length limits
- **Comprehensive logging** of all SMS and API interactions
- **Real-time log monitoring** and web-based log viewer
- **Performance metrics** (API response times, token usage)
- **System status dashboard** for monitoring

## Setup

### 1. Environment Variables

Copy `.env` and fill in your credentials:

```bash
# Twilio Configuration
TWILIO_SID=your_twilio_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE=your_twilio_phone_number_here

# xAI (Grok) API Configuration
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key_here
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment (once):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install packages (already done)
pip install flask openai twilio python-dotenv
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will run on `http://0.0.0.0:5001` (accessible from your local network)

## Twilio Webhook Configuration

1. Go to your Twilio Console
2. Navigate to Phone Numbers ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Active numbers
3. Click on your Twilio number
4. Set the webhook URL for incoming messages to the root path:
   ```
   https://your-domain.com/
   ```
   (Twilio requires the webhook at the root path for this setup)

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Home page with links to logs and status
- `GET /logs` - View recent application logs
- `GET /status` - System configuration and status
- `POST /` - Twilio webhook endpoint for incoming SMS

## Message Flow

1. User sends SMS to your Twilio number
2. Twilio sends webhook to `/` (root) endpoint
3. App processes message through Grok AI
4. AI response is sent back to user via Twilio
5. Webhook is acknowledged with TwiML response

## Configuration Options

- **Model**: Change `grok-4` to `grok-3-mini` for cost savings
- **Max Tokens**: Adjust `max_tokens` for response length
- **Temperature**: Modify `temperature` for creativity (0.0-1.0)

## Logging & Monitoring

### Log Files
- **`sms_bridge.log`** - Main application log file
- **Console output** - Real-time logs in terminal

### Log Content
- üì± Incoming SMS details (sender, message, timestamp)
- ü§ñ xAI API calls (request, response, duration, tokens)
- üì§ Twilio SMS sending (success/failure, duration, SID)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings and errors with full details
- üèÅ Complete webhook processing time

### Monitoring Tools
1. **Web Interface:**
   - Visit `/logs` to view recent logs
   - Visit `/status` for system configuration

2. **Web Interface Testing:**
   - Visit `/test` to test SMS webhook from browser
   
3. **Command Line Testing:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/ \
     -d 'Body=Hello from curl test' \
     -d 'From=+15551234567' \
     -d 'To=YOUR_TWILIO_NUMBER'
   ```

4. **Manual Log Viewing:**
   ```bash
   tail -f sms_bridge.log
   ```

## Testing Locally

For local testing, you can use tools like:
- ngrok (to expose local server to internet)
- Twilio CLI for testing webhooks
- Postman for API testing

### Running Behind NAT (Port Forwarding 5001)

If your server is behind a home/office router (NAT) and you want Twilio to reach it directly without a tunneling service:

1. Ensure the app listens on all interfaces. This app binds to `0.0.0.0:5001` by default.
2. Find your machine's LAN IP (e.g., `192.168.1.50`). On macOS:
   ```bash
   ipconfig getifaddr en0 || ipconfig getifaddr en1
   ```
3. In your router, create a port-forward rule:
   - External port: `5001` (TCP)
   - Forward to LAN IP: your machine's IP
   - Internal port: `5001` (TCP)
4. Allow inbound TCP 5001 on your host firewall (macOS may prompt to allow Python incoming connections on first run).
5. Verify from an external network (cellular):
   ```bash
   curl http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:5001/status
   ```
6. Set your Twilio webhook to:
   ```
   http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:5001/
   ```
   - Optional: use a Dynamic DNS hostname (e.g., `yourname.ddns.net`) instead of the public IP.
7. Recommended HTTPS: Place a reverse proxy (Caddy/Nginx) on your router/edge or server to terminate TLS on `:443` and proxy to `http://localhost:5001`.

Minimal Caddy example on the server (auto TLS with Let's Encrypt):
```bash
# Caddyfile
your-domain.example {
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:5001
}
```
Then set Twilio webhook to:
```
https://your-domain.example/
```

Notes:
- Some ISPs use CGNAT or block inbound ports; in that case, prefer a tunnel (e.g., ngrok) or deploy to a VPS.
- NAT loopback may not work from inside your LAN; test from outside (e.g., cellular).
